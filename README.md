## CalcZonio Hub 
This CalcZonio Hub is very efficient & helpful website created through <b> HTML, CSS, JavsScriptS</b>. In this website you can fint most type of calculator every daily to professional user can use it. It's a complex + simple mixture website.

## Features I have added:
- Favicon to all pages (favicon from flaticon).
- Cards at index page for easy navigation.
- Navbar at every page of Home & About for easy way to come back to main Home page.
- Clickable Cards added on index page.
- Use Cases for each calculator & converter page.

## Technologies\Resources I Used:
<b> HTML <br> CSS <br> JavaScript <br> Favicon from Flaticon website </b>

## Difficulties I faced:
It was highly moderate high for me to built this website from scratch I need to analyse assume which calculator need to add how much precision I am suppose to add, layouting was not easy for each media query needed attention. Debugging at some stages like favicon not working corrected need to debugged 2-3 times. Styling was a great task I had done which color is good & looking awesome was a bit reasoning for me. Making this type of website was journeous, adventurous, & reasoning but I have a great experiance from this website builting. Naming this website was reasoning but came to this name "CalcZonio Hub".
